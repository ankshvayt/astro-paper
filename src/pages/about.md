Welcome. I'm Ankur Shrivastav.

I lead product and growth at **Vestra AI**, where we're building an AI agent platform that lets anyone create agents through natural language — no code, no complex workflows.

Before this, I built and shut down **SuperMindMaps AI**, a GenAI-powered mind mapping tool. I killed it the week Google's NotebookLM shipped the same feature. Knowing when to stop is as important as knowing what to build.

I've also spent 8+ years building products at massive scale: 180M users at **ShareChat**, 160M at **Moj** (launched in a week when TikTok got banned). I prototype in code (NextJS, Python, LLM APIs) and run my own evals.

## Why this blog?

I believe that sharing knowledge is one of the best ways to learn and grow, especially in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Through this blog, I hope to:

- Document my findings in AI and LLM development.
- Share strategies for building effective AI products.
- Explore the concept of "Vibe Coding" and how AI is changing how we build.
- Connect with like-minded individuals in the tech community.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
